### Basis.
***Definition.***\\
A linearly independent set of vectors in $V$ which spans the space $V$.

***Technique.***\\
To show $S \subseteq V$ is a basis of $V$, we need to prove two things. First, $S$ is a linearly independent set, and second, vectors in $S$ spans $V$.
- First step: Let $S := \\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n\\}.$ We want to show that if $c_1\alpha_1 + \cdots + c_n\alpha_n = 0$, then $c_i = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. 
- Second step: Suppose $Y \in V$, then we can express $Y$ in terms of $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n$.\\

***Example.***
The columns of an invertible $n\times n$ matrix form a basis for $\mathbb{F}^n$.\\
The statement that the columns of a matrix $A$ form a basis of $\mathbb{F}$ means that every vector $v \in \mathbb{F}^n$ can be uniquely written as a linear combination of them, in other words, the equation $Ax = v$ has a unique solution $x$ (denote the rows of $A$ by $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$, and denote the vector in $\mathbb{F}^n$ by $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$. We want to find out if $v$ can be expressed using the columns of $A$, ie. if $v_i = c_1A_1 + c_2A_2 + \cdots + c_nA_n$ for some constants in $\mathbb{F}$. If there does exist $x \in \mathbb{F}^n$, then we have found a unique way to obtain $v$ using the columns of $A$).
