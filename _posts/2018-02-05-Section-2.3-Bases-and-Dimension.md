### Basis.
***Definition.***\\
A linearly independent set of vectors in $V$ which spans the space $V$.

***Technique.***\\
To show $S \subseteq V$ is a basis of $V$, we need to prove two things. First, $S$ is a linearly independent set, and second, vectors in $S$ spans $V$.
- First step: Let $S := \\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n\\}.$ We want to show that if $c_1\alpha_1 + \cdots + c_n\alpha_n = 0$, then $c_i = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. 
- Second step: Suppose $Y \in V$, then we can express $Y$ in terms of $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n$.\\

***Example.***
The columns of an invertible $n\times n$ matrix form a basis for $\mathbb{F}^n$.\\
Let $A\in M_{n,n}(\mathbb{F})$ be invertible. Then it is row-equivalent to the identity matrix $I_n$. Let $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n$ denotes the columns of $I_n$. Then $k_1C_1 + k_2C_2 + \ldots + k_nC_n = 0$ implies $k_i = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. Since $A$ is row-equivalent to $I$, $m_1A_1 + m_2A_2 + \ldots + m_nA_n = 0$ implies $m_i = 0$. Therefore the columns of $A$ are linearly independent.

To say $\\{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\\}$ form a basis for $\mathbb{F}^n$, we are saying that each $v \in \mathbb{F}^n$ can be written as a unique linear combination of $\\{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\\}$. In other words, the equation $Ax = v$ must have a unique solution. Since $A$ is invertible, there exists a solution $x = A^{-1}v \in \mathbb{F}^n$. Suppose $Ax = v$ and $Ay = v$, then $x = A^{-1}v = y$, which means the solution is unique. 


Hence, the columns of an invertible $n \times n$ matrix form a basis for $\mathbb{F}^n$.
