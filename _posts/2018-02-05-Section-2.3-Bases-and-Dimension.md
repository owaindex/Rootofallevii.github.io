### Basis.
***Definition.***\\
A linearly independent set of vectors in $V$ which spans the space $V$.

***Technique.***\\
To show $S \subseteq V$ is a basis of $V$, we need to prove two things. First, $S$ is a linearly independent set, and second, vectors in $S$ spans $V$.

First step: Let $S := \\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n\\}.$ We want to show that if $c_1\alpha_1 + \cdots + c_n\alpha_n = 0$, then $c_i = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. 

Second step: Suppose $Y \in V$, then we can express $Y$ in terms of $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n$.

***Example.***\\
Let $P$ be an invertible $n \times n$ matrix with entries in $\mathbb{F}$. Then $P_1, \ldots, P_n$, the columns of $P$ forms a basis for the space of column matrices, $\mathbb{F}^{n\times 1}$. We see that as follows.

If $X$ is a column matrix, then $PX = x_1P_1 + \cdots + x_nP_n$. Since $PX = 0$ has the only trivial solution $X=0$ (see chapter 1 notes), it follows that $\\{P_1, \ldots, P_n\\}$ is linearly independent. 

Let $Y \in $\mathbb{F}^{n\times 1}$ be any column matrix.
