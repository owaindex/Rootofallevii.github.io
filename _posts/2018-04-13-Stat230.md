Unlike the advanced math courses, Stat 230 has a well-formatted course note and thus I didn't write a complete set of notes like I did for Math 148. I wrote notes for the last chapters because they are a bit more challenging compare to the beginning of the course (they are not full notes by any means; the abstract in chapter 9 notes is still Lorem ipsum lol...).



Cheers, David.
