##### A few remarks to whoever is reading this:

1. This is not the final version of my notes but it is the best version I can find -- I forgot to backup the original markdown file before I reinstalled my OS but it turned out that I have shared this .html file with my friends via messenger, bless..

2. Again, Typora's PDF export is as miserable as it can get, so I had to convert and post .html file here.

3. **If you are taking Math 136 and encounter stuff that you have never seen before in this document, don't panic, it is probably stuff from Math 146.** I dropped Math 146 right before the deadline because it was consuming too much time, but later I realize the beauty of  its abstraction and had to put some of my favorite pieces into this.

Cheers, David.
