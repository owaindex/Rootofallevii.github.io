### Matrix and Linear Combination
***Question.***\\
If $\mathbb{C}$ is the field of complex numbers, which vectors in $\mathbb{C}^3$ are linear combinations of $(1, 0, -1), (0, 1, 1)$ 
and $(1, 1, 1)$?

***Solution.***\\
Let $A, B, C \in \mathbb{C}$. Let $(a_1, a_2, a_3), (b_1, b_2, b_3), (c_1, c_2, c_3) \in \mathbb{C}^3$. Then the linear combinations of these three vectors are in the form of $A \cdot (a_1, a_2, a_3) + B \cdot (b_1, b_2, b_3) + C \cdot (c_1, c_2, c_3)$. Writing them out in vector form, we have  

$$ A \cdot \begin{bmatrix}a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{bmatrix} + B \cdot \begin{bmatrix}b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{bmatrix} + C \cdot \begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ c_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} Aa_1 \\ Aa_2 \\ Aa_3 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} Bb_1 \\ Bb_2 \\ Bb_3 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} Cc_1 \\ Cc_2 \\ Cc_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} Aa_1 + Bb_1 + Cc_1 \\ Aa_2 + Bb_2 + Cc_2 \\ Aa_3 + Bb_3 + Cc_3\end{bmatrix} .$$

Now if we put these three vectors into one matrix, ie. 

$$ \begin{bmatrix} a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\ a_2 & b_2 & c_2 \\ a_3 & b_3 & c_3 \end{bmatrix},$$

observe that 

$$ \begin{bmatrix} a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\ a_2 & b_2 & c_2 \\ a_3 & b_3 & c_3 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} A \\ B \\ C \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} Aa_1 + Bb_1 + Cc_1 \\ Aa_2 + Bb_2 + Cc_2 \\ Aa_3 + Bb_3 + Cc_3\end{bmatrix} !$$

We now put our three vectors into one matrix (each column represents a vector), ie. 

$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix},$$

and reduce this matrix (the augment matrix with the right side being $I_3$) to RRE form, we have:


$$\left[\begin{array}{rrr|rrr} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array}\right] \Rightarrow \left[\begin{array}{rrr|rrr} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 1\end{array}\right],$$

therefore the matrix is invertible and $AX = Y$ has a solution $X = A^{-1}Y$ for any $Y$. It follows that any vector $Y \in \mathbb{C}^3$ can be written as a linear combination of these three vectors.

### Definition of Vector Space
***Question.***\\
On $\mathbb{R}^n$, define two operations

$$ \alpha \oplus \beta = \alpha - \beta \\ c \cdot \alpha = - c \alpha$$

The operations on the right are the usual ones. Which of the axioms for a vector space are satisfied by $(\mathbb{R}^n, \oplus, \cdot)$? 

***Solution.***\\
There are nine axioms to check. \\
Hint: Plus is not commutative nor associative; there exists **right** additive identity and **right** additive inverses; there does not exist a multiplicative identity; the scalar multiplication is not associative; both the scalar and vector distributivities fail to exist.

### Complex Field and Axioms of Vector Space
***Question.*** \\ Let $V$ be the set of all complex-valued functions $f$ on the real line such that (for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$), $f(-t) = \overline{f(t)}$. The bar denotes complex conjugation. Show that $V$, with the operations 

$$ (f+g)(t) = f(t)+g(t) \\ (cf)(t) = cf(t)$$

is a vector space over the $\mathbb{R}$. Give an example of a function in $V$ which is not real-valued. 

***Solution.*** \\ Recall that $\overline{a+b} = \overline{a} + \overline{b}$ and $\overline{ab} = \overline{a}\cdot\overline{b}$. \\
First, we need to show that the addition and scalar multiplication are closed in $V$. 

$$ (f + g) (-t) = f(-t) + g(-t) = \overline{f(t)} + \overline{g(t)} = \overline{f(t) + g(t)} = \overline{(f+g)(t)} \\
(cf)(-t) = cf(-t) = c\overline{f(t)} = \overline{cf(t)} \text{ since }c \in \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \overline{c} = c.$$

The operations are well-defined, so we can now show the properties hold: 
1. Since $\mathbb{C}$ is associative and commutative, $V$ inherits the associativity and commutativity.
2. The zero function $0(t) = 0 \in V$ since $-0 = \overline{0}$.
3. $-f(t)$ is the additive inverse of $f(t)$.
4. $1(t) = t \in V$.
5. Associativity in $C$ implies the associative of scalar multiplication.
6. Both distributivity laws can be inherited from $\mathbb{C}$.

An example of a function in $V$ which is not real valued is $f(x) = ix$, since $f(-x) = -ix = \overline{ix}$.
