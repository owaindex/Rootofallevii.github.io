# Theorems about Matrices

### Basic Properties of Matrices

***Theorem 1.*** 
Equivalent systems have the same solutions.

***Theorem 2.***
Each elementary row operation has an inverse.

***Theorem 3.***
If $A$ and $B$ are row-equivalent, then $AX = 0$ and $BX = 0$ have the same solutions.

### Row-Reduced Matrices

***Theorem 4.***
Every matrix has a row-equivalent row-reduced matrix.

***Theorem 5.***
Every matrix has a row-equivalent row-reduced echelon matrix.

***Theorem 6.***
If $A$ has dimension $m \times n$ with $m < n$, then $AX = 0$ has a non-trivial solution.

***Proof 6.***
Think in terms of system of linear equations. Given $m$ equations of $n$ unknowns, we have at least
