### Notes.
1. To show a non-empty subset $W$ of $V$ is a subspace of $V$: show that for all $\alpha, \beta \in V$, $c \in \mathbb{F}$, $c\alpha + \beta \in W$. 
2. The solution space of a aystem of homogeneous linear equations is a subspace. Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}$. Then the set of all $n \times 1$ matrixs $X$ over $\mathbb{F}$ such that $AX = 0$ is a subspace of the space of all $n \times 1$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}$. To prove this, we would show $A(cX + Y) = 0$ when $AX = 0 = AY$ and $c \in \mathbb{F}$.

### Span.
***Theorem.***\\
Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{F}$. The intersection of any collection of subspaces of $V$ is a subspace of $V$.

***Proof.***\\
Let $\{W_a\}$ be a collection of subspaces of $V$ and let $W = \cap_a W_a$ be their intersection. Recall that $W$ is defined as the set of all elements belonging to every $W_a$. Since each $W_a$ is a subspace, each contains the zero vector, thus the intersection contains the zero vector. Let$\alpha, \beta \in W, c \in \mathbb{F}$. By definition of $W$, both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ belong to each $W_a$, and because each of them is a subspace, $(c\alpha + \beta)$ belongs to every $W_a$. Thus $(c\alpha + \beta) \in W$. It follows that $W$ is a subspace of $V$. 

***Definition.***\\
(From Math 136. I hate the definition in Hoffman's textbook.) 
The span of a set of vectors $\mathcal{B} = \\{v_1, \ldots, v_k\\}$ is the set of all linear combinations of the vectors in the set. That is, $\text{ span }\mathcal{B} = \\{c_1v_1 + \cdots + c_kv_k : c_i \in \mathbb{F}\\}$.

### Identify Subspaces (Vectors)
***Question.***\\
Which of the following sets of vectors $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n (n\geq 3)$?

1. $A :=$ all $\alpha$ such that $\alpha_1 \geq 0$.
  - This is not a subspace: $(1, \ldots, 1)$'s additive inverse is $(-1, \ldots, -1)\notin A$.
2. $B :=$ all $\alpha$ such that $\alpha_1 + 3\alpha_2 = \alpha_3$.
  - This is a subspace: suppose $a = (a_1, \ldots, a_n), b = (b_1, \ldots, b_n) \in B, c \in \mathbb{R}$. 
  - We want to show that $c(a_1, \ldots, a_n) + (b_1, \ldots, b_n) = (ca_1+b_1, \ldots, ca_n+b_n)$. 
  - Now $(ca_1 + b_1) + 3(ca_2+b_2) = c(a_1+3a_2) + (b_1+3b_2) = c(a_3)+(b_3) = ca_3 + b_3.$ 
  - This satisfies the condition and hence $B$ is a subspace.
3. $C :=$ all $\alpha$ such that$a_2 = a_1^2$.
  - This is not a subspace.
  - Note that $(1, 1, \ldots, 1)$ satisfies the condition, but $(1, \ldots, 1) + (1, \ldots, 1) = (2, \ldots, 2)$ does not.
4. $D :=$ all $\alpha$ such that $\alpha_1\alpha_2 = 0$.
  - This is not a subspace. 
  - Note that $(1, 0, \ldots)$ and $(0, 1, \ldots)$ satisfy the condition, but $(1, 1, \ldots)$ does not.
5. $E :=$ all $\alpha$ such that $\alpha_2 \in \mathbb{Q}$. 
  - This is not a subspace.
  - Note that $\pi \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\pi(1, 1, \ldots) = (\pi, \pi, \ldots) \notin E$.

### Identify Subspaces (Functions)
***Question.***\\
Let $V$ be the real vector space of all function $f$ from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$. Which of the following sets of functions are subspaces of $V$?

1. $A :=$ all $f$ such that $f(x^2) = f^2(x)$.
  - This is not a subspace.
  - Let $f(x) = x, g(x) = x^2$. $f, g \in A$ since $f(x^2) = x^2 = f^2(x), g(x^2) = x^4 = g^2(x)$.
  - If $A$ is a subspace, then $(f+g)(x^2)$ should equal to $(f+g)^2(x)$.
  - $(f+g)(x^2) = f(x^2) + g(x^2) = x^2 + x^4$.
  - $(f+g)^2(x) = [(f+g)(x)]^2 = [f(x)+g(x)]^2 = [x+x^2]^2 = x^4+2x^3+x^2 \ne x^2+x^4$.
  - Thus it is not a subspace.
2. $B :=$ all $f$ such that $f(0) = f(1)$.
  - This is a subspace.
  - Suppose $f, g \in B$. That is, $f(0) = f(1), g(0) = g(1)$.
  - Then $(cf + g)(0) = cf(0) + g(0) = cf(1) + g(1) = (cf+g)(1) \in B$.
3. $C :=$ all $f$ such that $f(3) = 1 + f(-5)$.
  - This is not a subspace.
  - Suppose $f(3) = 1$ and $f(x) = 0$ when $x \ne 3$, $g(-5) = 0$ and $g(x) = 1$ when $x \ne -5$.
  - $(f + g)(3) = f(3) + g(3) = 2 \neq 1+(f+g)(-5) = 1 + f(-5) + g(-5) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1$.
  - Thus $C$ is not a subspace.
