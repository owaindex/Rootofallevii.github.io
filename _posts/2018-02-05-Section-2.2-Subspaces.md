### Notes.
1. To show a non-empty subset $W$ of $V$ is a subspace of $V$: show that for all $\alpha, \beta \in V$, $c \in \mathbb{F}$, $c\alpha + \beta \in W$. 
2. The solution space of a aystem of homogeneous linear equations is a subspace. Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}$. Then the set of all $n \times 1$ matrixs $X$ over $\mathbb{F}$ such that $AX = 0$ is a subspace of the space of all $n \times 1$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}$. To prove this, we would show $A(cX + Y) = 0$ when $AX = 0 = AY$ and $c \in \mathbb{F}$.
