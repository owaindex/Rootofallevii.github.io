### Notes.
1. To show a non-empty subset $W$ of $V$ is a subspace of $V$: show that for all $\alpha, \beta \in V$, $c \in \mathbb{F}$, $c\alpha + \beta \in W$. 
2. The solution space of a aystem of homogeneous linear equations is a subspace. Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}$. Then the set of all $n \times 1$ matrixs $X$ over $\mathbb{F}$ such that $AX = 0$ is a subspace of the space of all $n \times 1$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}$. To prove this, we would show $A(cX + Y) = 0$ when $AX = 0 = AY$ and $c \in \mathbb{F}$.

### Span.
***Theorem.***\\
Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{F}$. The intersection of any collection of subspaces of $V$ is a subspace of $V$.

***Proof.***\\
Let $\{W_a\}$ be a collection of subspaces of $V$ and let $W = \cap_a W_a$ be their intersection. Recall that $W$ is defined as the set of all elements belonging to every $W_a$. Since each $W_a$ is a subspace, each contains the zero vector, thus the intersection contains the zero vector. Let$\alpha, \beta \in W, c \in \mathbb{F}$. By definition of $W$, both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ belong to each $W_a$, and because each of them is a subspace, $(c\alpha + \beta)$ belongs to every $W_a$. Thus $(c\alpha + \beta) \in W$. It follows that $W$ is a subspace of $V$. 

***Definition.***\\
(From Math 136. I hate the definition in Hoffman's textbook.) 
The span of a set of vectors $\mathcal{B} = \\{v_1, \ldots, v_k\\}$ is the set of all linear combinations of the vectors in the set. That is, $\text{span }\mathcal{B} = \\{c_1v_1 + \cdots + c_kv_k : c_i \in \mathbb{F}\\}$.

### Identify Subspaces
***Question.***\\
Which of the following sets of vectors $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n (n\geq 3)$?

1. $A :=$ all $\alpha$ such that $\alpha_1 \geq 0$.
  - This is not a subspace: $(1, \ldots, 1)$'s additive inverse is $(-1, \ldots, -1)\notin A$.
2. $B :=$ all $\alpha$ such that $\alpha_1 + 3\alpha_2 = \alpha_3$.
  - This is a subspace: suppose $a = (a_1, \ldots, a_n), b = (b_1, \ldots, b_n) \in B, c \in \mathbb{R}$. We want to show that $$c(a_1, \ldots, a_n) + (b_1, \ldots, b_n) = (ca_1+b_1, \ldots, ca_n+b_n)$$. Now $$(ca_1 + b_1) + 3(ca_2+b_2) = c(a_1+3a_2) + (b_1+3b_2) = c(a_3)+(b_3) = ca_3 + b_3$$. This satisfies the condition and hence $B$ is a subspace.
