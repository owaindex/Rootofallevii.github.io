Hi, I'm David! 

I'm currently pursing a Computer Science degree at the University of Waterloo (estimated 2022). I am very passionate about math and CS and hope to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world problems. This website is mainly a collection of my notes and journals that I think others might find helpful. Please find my resumes in PDF at the links below.
